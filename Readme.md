# Hextech Friends v1.0

Hextech Friends is a small application trying to simplify the process of playing with friends.
The project is used to create invite "url's", to allow easy joining of lobbys, and potentially sharing runepages and adding friends. 

The process of this is as follows:
 
1) User 1 creates a link in a small desktop application. (This application registers the open game at a private api)
2) Friends are clicking on the link, which opens the desktop app on their pc's and asks them if they want to join the lobby / add User 1 to friendlist / add runepage (depending on the type of link)
3) Application reports back to User 1's app, which automatically invites said friends (or does the other actions mentioned before).

This application uses  The client apis: lol-lobby/v2, lol-summoner/v1/current-summoner
